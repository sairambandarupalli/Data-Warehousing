Realtime MeshJoin algorithm within a data warehousing context.
Sure, here are the steps in single lines:

Follow these steps for complete setup for this project.

1. Download and install Eclipse IDE from https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/.
2. Download and install the latest Java Development Kit (JDK) from https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html.
3. Download and install MySQL Community Server and MySQL Workbench from https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/.
4. Download and install Git from https://git-scm.com/downloads and optionally GitHub Desktop.
5. Download and install Apache Maven from https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi.
6. Configure Git with your name and email using `git config` commands.
7. Optionally, download and install Tableau or Power BI for data visualization.
8. Set environment variables `JAVA_HOME` for JDK and `MAVEN_HOME` for Maven.
9. Launch Eclipse and configure it to use the installed JDK.
10. Create a new Java project in Eclipse for the Realtime MeshJoin implementation.
11. Configure Maven in your Eclipse project by adding the Maven nature to it.
12. Import necessary libraries and dependencies for your project using Maven's `pom.xml` file.
13. Create a MySQL database for "Metro" using MySQL Workbench.
14. Clone or create a new repository on GitHub for version control of your project.
15. Write Java code in Eclipse to implement the Realtime MeshJoin algorithm.
16. Use JUnit for writing test cases to validate your implementation.
17. Commit and push your code to GitHub regularly to track changes.
18. Optionally, use Tableau or Power BI to visualize the results of your algorithm and ETL processes.
